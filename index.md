<h2 class="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>The main goal for this project is  to make a fully functioning game using a third party SDL library in 3D using raycasting that would challenge the player to think outside of the box and move in a different direction.</p>
<p>Another goal included adding enemies(e.g. obstacle ) to make the game interesting and using weapons . Finally, the constraint for time was an issue because the project took a lot of time..</p>

  <h2 class="about">About</h2> 
So why did I choose such a project? The purpose of this project for me is firstly,
  <ul>
<li> to learn the mathematics and physics behind developing the game and learn computer graphics concepts like how to render</li>
<li> to learn how to develop a game without a game engine, without using the best free game engine like Unity or Unreal.</li>
<li>finally, it is Alx portfolio project.</li>
  </ul>
