# Maze-Game

The Goal of this project is to create a game by using a third party SDL library in 3D using raycasting!
So why did I choose such a project? The purpose of this project for me is firstly, to learn the mathematics and physics behind developing the game and learn computer graphics concepts like how to render , secondly, to learn how to develop a game without a game engine, without using the best free game engine like Unity or Unreal.
# About SDL2
-simple DirectMedia Layer(SDL) is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. It is used by video playback software, emulators, and popular games including Valveâ€™s award winning catalog and many Humble Bundle games.

SDL is written in C, works natively with C++, and there are bindings available for several other languages.
